# About this project #

ManagedSQLite is a managed implementation of the public domain relational database SQLite.

Currently, ManagedSQLite works with Microsoft Visual C# 2005, Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 and Microsoft Visual C++ 2005.

Unlike other managed wrappers for SQLite, ManagedSQLite only requires its own DLL with no need for the SQLite DLL file - reducing the risk of DLL Hell.

# Current version #
1.0.0.01340 (SQLite 3.4.0 with FTS1 and FTS2)
